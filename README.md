# Breastcancer-Classification
This is the code for a trained Neural network on dataset which contains data about Breast cancer x-ray images(taken from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic) ). The neural network is deployed using tensorflow.js.
The aim is to predict whether a given xray is diagnosed with Breast Cancer or not. The neural network contains one layer with 5 nodes, all activated using the ReLu activation and finally sealed with an output layer with a single neuron which is Activated by sigmoid. 
The model was compiled over 100 epochs, completing with a Loss: 0.00017783457587938756 and an Accuracy: 1
